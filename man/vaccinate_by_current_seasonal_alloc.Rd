\usage{
vaccinate_by_current_seasonal_alloc(sum_age_risk_func, travel_matrix,
  vax_allocation_params, S, E, I, R, SV, EV, IV, RV, incidence, vax_pool)
}
\arguments{
\item{sum_age_risk_func}{a function which sums a vector across age and risk groups (created automatically in the code)}

\item{travel_matrix}{a square matrix with side length n_countries. Travel_matrix[x,y] is the proportion of time an individual in location x spends in location y}

\item{vax_allocation_params}{list of parameters for vaccine allocation}

\item{S}{numeric vector of length n. number of unvaccinated susceptibles.
n is number of locations * number of age groups * number of risk groups}

\item{E}{numeric vector of length n. number of unvaccinated exposed}

\item{I}{numeric vector of length n. number of unvaccinated infectious}

\item{R}{numeric vector of length n. number of unvaccinated recovered}

\item{SV}{numeric vector of length n. number of vaccinated susceptibles.}

\item{EV}{numeric vector of length n. number of vaccinated exposed}

\item{IV}{numeric vector of length n. number of vaccinated infectious}

\item{RV}{numeric vector of length n. number of vaccinated recovered}

\item{incidence}{numeric vector of length n. incidence}

\item{vax_pool}{numeric vector of length 1. number of vaccines available}
}
\value{
n_vax_allocated numeric vector of length n_countries.  number of vaccines allocated to each country
}
\description{
allocate vaccines according to current seasonal allocation in each location, then
allocate uniformly within each country (without discriminating between
ages/risk groups/infection statuses)
}
